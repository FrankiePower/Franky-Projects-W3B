## Todo Dapp

A secure and transparent todo app powered by smart contracts on the blockchain.

## Description

This project implements a smart contract for a decentralized todo app. Users can create, mark complete, and view their tasks on the blockchain. This approach offers several benefits:

- **Immutability:** Tasks cannot be tampered with once added to the blockchain.
- **Transparency:** Anyone can verify the existence and completion status of tasks.
- **Decentralization:** No single entity controls the data, reducing the risk of downtime or censorship.

This smart contract is written in Solidity and can be deployed on a blockchain platform like Ethereum.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

- Familiarity with blockchain technology and smart contracts.
- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- A development environment with Solidity support (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat).

## Installation:

1. Clone the project repository:

2. Install dependencies:

cd 5. TO-DO CONTRACT
npm install

```

## **Execution:**

1. Follow the instructions for your chosen development environment to deploy the smart contract to a blockchain network. (Instructions vary depending on the environment).

2. Interact with the deployed contract using your development environment's tools or a front-end application.
